\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank the members of the Innovative Computing Laboratory and its support staff for all of the opportunities that they have provided to me, and students like me. I would specifically like to thank my research group, George Bosilca, Thomas Herault, Aurelien Bouteiller, Stephanie Moreaud, Teng Ma, Peng Du, Wes Alvaro, and Blake Haugen for their direction and advice throughout my studies. I would also like to thank Sam Crawford for his many efforts of editing support. To my family, who have provided support, advice, and understanding, I cannot thank you enough and will continue to covet all of those things in my future endeavors.
