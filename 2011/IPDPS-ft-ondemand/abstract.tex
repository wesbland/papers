The International Exascale Software Project roadmaps predicts, as soon
as 2014, billion way parallel machines encompassing not only millions
of cores, but also tens of thousands of nodes. Even considering
extremely optimistic advances in hardware reliability, probabilistic
amplification entails that failures will be unavoidable. Consequently,
software fault tolerance is of paramount importance to maintain future
scientific productivity. Currently, two major problems hinder
ubiquitous adoption of fault tolerance techniques: 1) traditional
checkpoint based approaches incur a steep overhead on failure free
operations and 2) the dominant programming paradigm for parallel
applications (the MPI standard and its implementations) offers
extremely limited support of software-level fault tolerance
approaches.  In this paper, we present an approach that relies
exclusively on the current MPI standard definition of a high quality
implementation and enables algorithmic based recovery to complete the
computation despite failures without incurring the overhead of
customary periodic checkpointing.
