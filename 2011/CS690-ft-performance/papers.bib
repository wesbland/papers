title = {{GASNet: A Portable High-Performance Communication Layer for Global Address-Space Languages}},
journal = {CS258 Parallel Computer Architecture Project. Spring},
year = {2002},
note = {Shared Memory - One large space accessed by loads and stores.
Distributed Memory - Memory is distributed over many spaces and is used via message passing.

UPC - Makes it seem like a shared memory model regardless of underlying hardware.
	Divides memory into private address spaces and a public one.
	Objects have "affinity" for a particular space (stored on that node)

UPC translated to C which is compiled and linked to any runtime and communication system
	Uses GASNet for communication

GASNet partitioned into two layers
	GASNet core API
		Based on Active Messages
		Implemented directly on individual network architectures
	GASNet extended API
		Written on top of core, but can be bypassed and reimplemented to improve performance
		Includes RMA

Active Messages
	3 Sizes
		Small: All messages have some int arguements
		Medium: Data stored in temp buffer
		Long: DMA transfer with location specified by sender before handler runs

Core API provides many ways of handling messages
	Hardware interrupts
	Interrupts/Polling combo
	Private asynchronous communications thread
	NIC processors

Extended API has 3 types of message transfers
	Simple blocking get/put
	Explicit-handle non-blocking operations
		Handle passed to synchronizer (one or many at a time)
	Implicit-handle non-blocking operations
		Completed using general synch functions
	All provide mem-to-mem transfers.
	Some provide mem-to-register

Active Message handlers are entirely polling-based
GASNet does not use polling (intterupts, etc.)

Hard to work out handlers blocking for locks
	Don't want to circular wait

No-interrupt sections ensure a thread won't be interupted by GASNet

Handler-Safe Lock: Only lock that's safe within handlers for locking main-line client code}

@article{DBLP:conf/pvm/SchneidenbachBS08,
author = {Schneidenbach, Lars and B{\"o}hme, David and Schnor, Bettina},
title = {{Performance Issues of Synchronisation in the MPI-2 One-Sided Communication API}},
journal = {Proceedings},
pages = {177--184},
note = {Quickly discusses NEON.

Early sender problem makes pipeline inefficient.

Every communication (1 or 2-sided) has 4 API calls.
	The difference is how many operations are synched at once.

MPI-OSC-2 combines notification and completion into MPI{\_}Win{\_}complete or MPI{\_}Win{\_}fence.
Doesn't allow overlap of local operations to run while communication is working.

If communication is initiated right after a post, the local process might not have received the post yet so sommunication is pushed to the synch phase unless communication is in another background process.

Having the notification and completion in one call slows things down.  Separation would speed things up.
They want to use a flag on the messages to notifiy which message is final in the epoch.

NEON uses the flag with put operations.  By default a message is final.  
The flag can be set to signal that more data is coming.}
