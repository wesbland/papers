Dear Wesley, Peng, Aurelien, Thomas, George and Jack:

We are pleased to invite you to submit an extended version of your Euro-Par 2012
paper:

A Checkpoint-on-Failure Protocol for Algorithm-Based Recovery in Standard MPI

for a special issue on Euro-Par 2012 in the journal "Concurrency and
Computation: Practice and Experience". This invitation goes only to very few,
select papers. We would expect your submission by November 4. You have already
indicated that you are willing to participate. Please submit via the Web site of
the journal, answering "Yes" and stating "Euro-Par 2012" at the question of
whether you are submitting to a special issue.

In order to satisfy the requirement of originality, your submission must have a
slightly modified title and must contain at least 20% additional, original
material. This could be spent going into more depth on issues covered in the
Euro-Par paper, or it could address related research questions and results not
covered in the Euro-Par paper.

The page limit is 17 pages (please do not exceed it) and the journal is offering
its format in a style file. Please submit in this format, singly spaced as the
paper would appear.

Please cite your Euro-Par 2012 paper and state explicitly in the introduction
that this is an extension of the conference paper. Also, please accompany your
submission with a letter to the reviewers, in which you describe the differences
to the Euro-Par version.

With best regards,   Chris Lengauer and Luc Bouge
