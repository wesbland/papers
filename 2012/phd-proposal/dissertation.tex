\section{Dissertation Statement}\label{sect:dissertation}

The goal of the dissertation is to demonstrate novel methods of fault tolerance
supporting Algorithm Based Fault Tolerance (ABFT) for large scale systems using
the message passing paradigm with extensions to facilitate concurrent approaches
to cope with failures. By allowing applications to continue execution after a
hardware failure, algorithms can support larger scale and longer running
executions previously found to be unattainable.
