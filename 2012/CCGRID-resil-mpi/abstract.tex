\begin{abstract}

As recent research has demonstrated, it is becoming a necessity for large scale
applications to have the ability to tolerate process failure during an
execution. As the number of processes increases, checkpoint/restart fault
tolerance approaches requiring large concurrent state checkpointing become untenable and radically new
methods to address fault tolerance are needed. This work addresses these
challenges by proposing a novel approach to a minimalistic fault discovery and
management model.  Such a model allows application to run to
completion despite fail-stop failures. As a proof of concept, in addition to the
proposed fault tolerance model, an implementation in the context of the \ompi
library is provided, evaluated and analyzed.
% as well as providing a corresponding implementation in the context of the

% includes modifications to the \ompi runtime as well as MPI library to give the
% user options when deciding how best to implement fault tolerance.
