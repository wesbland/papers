As recent research has demonstrated, it is becoming a necessity for large scale applications to have the ability to tolerate process failure during an execution. As the number of processes increases, checkpoint/restart style fault tolerance requiring large concurrent state checkpointing becomes untenable and radically new methods to address fault tolerance are needed. This work addresses these challenges by proposing two new approaches for minimalistic fault discovery and management methods. The Checkpoint-on-Failure method provides an ABFT method similar to existing checkpoint/restart paradigms. User Level Failure Mitigation introduces an entirely new form of fault management using extensions to the existing MPI standard to provide users with mechanisms to detect and handle failures at the application level.
