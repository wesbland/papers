\section{Academic Progress} \label{sect:academics}

I have completed most of the coursework required for the Ph. D. degree in Computer Science at the University of Tennessee. As part of my degree, I have also fulfilled the requirements for the Interdepartmental Graduate Minor in Computational Science. This minor is designed to augment standard coursework with an emphasis on courses directly related to high performance computing. A selection my coursework for both my major and minor fields of study include: Distributed Systems, Algorithms, Operating Systems, Data Mining, Scientific Computing for Engineers, Compilers, Numerical Analysis, Industrial Mathematics.

In addition to my coursework, I have also made presentations of my research for the Innovative Computing Laboratory on numerous occasions~\footnote{March 9, 2012, March 21, 2011, Augusts 2008 - 2012}, for the PetaApps Research Team~\footnote{March 2012, August 2011, January 2011}, as well as the Cluster Clouds and Grid Computing Doctoral Symposium in May 2012.

My peer-reviewed published works can be found in~\cite{Bland:CCGrid12, Bland:EuroPar12, Bland:EuroMPI12}, including a ``Best Paper'' award at EuroPar '12. In addition, I also participated in the User Level Failure Mitigation Proposal~\footnote{https://svn.mpi-forum.org/trac/mpi-forum-web/ticket/323} which is being presented and discussed at the MPI forum for inclusion in an upcoming version of the MPI Standard.
