\section{Plan of Study} \label{sect:planofstudy}

By the very nature of the research described here, a heavy use of HPC resources is required. While initial development of the ULFML proposal took place on smaller scale (16 node) clusters, it is currently being ported to the Kraken supercomputer at the University of Tennessee / National Institute for Computation Sciences. Once operational on Kraken, it will serve as an example for other MPI libraries to develop their own implementations of the fault tolerance we propose on other large scale systems. Other HPC machines were used to facilitate development of the resilient runtime including Grid'5000 in France~\footnote{Experiments presented in this paper were carried out using the Grid'5000 experimental testbed, being developed under the INRIA ALADDIN development action with support from CNRS, RENATER and several Universities as well as other funding bodies (see https://www.grid5000.fr).}
