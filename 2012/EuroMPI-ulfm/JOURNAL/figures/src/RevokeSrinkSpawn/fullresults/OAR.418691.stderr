[[50132,1],1][btl_openib_component.c:3426:handle_wc] from griffon-2.nancy.grid5000.fr to: griffon-2 error polling LP CQ with status RETRY EXCEEDED ERROR status number 12 for wr_id a76000 opcode 32767  vendor error 129 qp_idx 0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The InfiniBand retry count between two MPI processes has been
exceeded.  "Retry count" is defined in the InfiniBand spec 1.2
(section 12.7.38):

    The total number of times that the sender wishes the receiver to
    retry timeout, packet sequence, etc. errors before posting a
    completion error.

This error typically means that there is something awry within the
InfiniBand fabric itself.  You should note the hosts on which this
error has occurred; it has been observed that rebooting or removing a
particular host from the job can sometimes resolve this issue.

Two MCA parameters can be used to control Open MPI's behavior with
respect to the retry count:

* btl_openib_ib_retry_count - The number of times the sender will
  attempt to retry (defaulted to 7, the maximum value).
* btl_openib_ib_timeout - The local ACK timeout parameter (defaulted
  to 20).  The actual timeout value used is calculated as:

     4.096 microseconds * (2^btl_openib_ib_timeout)

  See the InfiniBand spec 1.2 (section 12.7.34) for more details.

Below is some information about the host that raised the error and the
peer to which it was connected:

  Local host:   griffon-2.nancy.grid5000.fr
  Local device: mlx4_0
  Peer host:    griffon-2

You may need to consult with your system administrator to get this
problem fixed.
