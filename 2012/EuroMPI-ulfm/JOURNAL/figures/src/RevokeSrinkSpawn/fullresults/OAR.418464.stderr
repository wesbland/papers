WARNING: There is at least one OpenFabrics device found but there are
no active ports detected (or Open MPI was unable to use them).  This
is most certainly not what you wanted.  Check your cables, subnet
manager configuration, etc.  The openib BTL will be ignored for this
job.

  Local host: graphene-35.nancy.grid5000.fr

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
At least one pair of MPI processes are unable to reach each other for
MPI communications.  This means that no Open MPI device has indicated
that it can be used to communicate between these processes.  This is
an error; Open MPI requires that all MPI processes be able to reach
each other.  This error can sometimes be the result of forgetting to
specify the "self" BTL.

  Process 1 ([[45475,1],2]) is on host: graphene-125.nancy.grid5000.fr
  Process 2 ([[45475,1],0]) is on host: graphene-125
  BTLs attempted: openib self

Your MPI job is now going to abort; sorry.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MPI_INIT has failed because at least one MPI process is unreachable
from another.  This *usually* means that an underlying communication
plugin -- such as a BTL or an MTL -- has either not loaded or not
allowed itself to be used.  Your MPI job will now abort.

You may wish to try to narrow down the problem;

 * Check the output of ompi_info to see which BTL/MTL plugins are
   available.
 * Run your application with MPI_THREAD_SINGLE.
 * Set the MCA parameter btl_base_verbose to 100 (or mtl_base_verbose,
   if using MTL-based communications) to see exactly which
   communication plugins were considered and/or discarded.

An MPI process is aborting at a time when it cannot guarantee that all
of its peer processes in the job will be killed properly.  You should
double check that everything has shut down cleanly.
