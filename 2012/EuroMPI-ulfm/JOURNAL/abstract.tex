  As the scale of computing platforms becomes increasingly extreme, the
  requirements for application fault tolerance are increasing as
  well. Techniques to address this problem by improving the resilience of
  algorithms have been developed, but they currently receive no support from the
  programming model, and without such support, they are bound to fail. This
  paper discusses the failure-free overhead and recovery impact aspects of the
  User-Level Failure Mitigation proposal presented in the MPI Forum. Experiments
  demonstrate that fault-aware MPI has little or no impact on performance for a
  range of applications, and produces satisfactory recovery times when there are
  failures.
