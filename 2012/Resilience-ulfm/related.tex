Efforts toward fault tolerance in MPI have previously been attempted.  Automatic
fault tolerance~\cite{Bouteiller10Redesign,MPICHVblocking} is a compelling
approach for users, as failures are completely masked and handled internally by
the MPI library, which requires no new interfaces to MPI or application code
changes. Unfortunately, many recent studies point out that automatic approaches,
either based on checkpoints or replication, will exhibit poor efficiency on
Exaflop platforms~\cite{BOSILCA-2012-696154,lawn265}.

Application Based Fault Tolerance
(ABFT)~\cite{fthpl2011,pengduppopp12,huang1984algorithm} is another approach
that promises better scalability, at the cost of significant algorithm and 
application code changes. Despite some limited 
successes~\cite{europar12/onfailureckpt,Gropp:2004:FTM:1080704.1080714},
MPI interfaces need to be extended to effectively support ABFT. The most notable past 
effort is FT-MPI~\cite{fagg2000ft}, which provided several recovery modes for the user 
but was never standardized and therefore was not portable enough for most users.
